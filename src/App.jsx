       <h1 id="title">Adrian Monk, the best homicide detective in the world!</h1>
       <h2>Brief History</h2>
       <p>
       Monk is a renowned former homicide detective for the San Francisco Police Department. 
       Monk has obsessive-compulsive disorder and multiple phobias, all of which intensified after the 
       murder of his wife Trudy, resulting in his suspension from the police department. 
       He works as a private police homicide consultant and undergoes therapy with the ultimate goal of overcoming 
       his grief, taking control of his phobias and disorder, and being reinstated as a police detective. 
       While Monk's personal challenges and compulsions often cause problems and frustration for both himself and those 
       around him, his observational skills and keen attention to detail enable him to solve cases through 
       unconventional means. His 312 phobias include germs, needles, birds, heights, dentists, milk, death, 
       snakes, lightning, mushrooms, crowds and enclosed spaces.
